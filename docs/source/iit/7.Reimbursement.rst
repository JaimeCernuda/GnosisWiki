There will likely come a time when you have to purchase something on
your own credit card and then reimburse later. Generally speaking, you
will be required to pay for conferences, meals, flights, hotels, etc.
out-of-pocket at first, and then be reimbursed later.

The reimbursement process is arduous bureaucracy that requires receipts
and good bookkeeping. This page describes the reimbursement process
you’ll have to go through for IIT. This process is intended for
students. Professors and other staff may be slightly different.

case, unless there are some highly exceptional and unforseeable
circumstance.

If you type the word “registration” in the Expense Type box, there will
be two options: 1. Registration Fee (Domestic): if the conference was in
the USA 2. Registration Fee (Foreign): if the conference was outside of
the USA.

Choose the most appropriate option.

+=================================+
| conference registration expense |
+---------------------------------+

In the description, state something like: “Registration fee for the
[CONFERENCE] conference.”

Upload Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are required to prove two things: 1. You have a reason to be at the
conference. To prove this, upload an image of the conference program
where it shows your name and your research publication. Highlight your
name and your publication. 2. You paid for the conference. To prove
this, upload the receipt you got from the registration for the
conference.

7.6.5. Flight Ticket
--------------------

7.6.6. Hotel
------------

7.6.7. Ground Transportation
----------------------------

This includes trains, ubers, taxis, car rentals, etc.

7.6.8. Meal Expenses
--------------------

There are two general types of meal expenses: 1. **Per-Diems**: The “i
don’t want to keep receipts” options. Most grants allow you to purchase
meals without keeping receipts. An allowance is given for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner. 2. **Actuals**: The “i always keep the receipt”
option. If the grant doesn’t support per-diems, then use this.

Generally, I prefer the per-diem option if it’s available. It almost
always is. You don’t have to upload photos for every last thing.
Typically, the per diem rates are fairly gracious. You are allowed to
keep the money left over if you don’t spend the entire allocated budget.

7.7. Foreign Conference Considerations
======================================

1. Europe and USA have different power outlets. USA is 110V, whereas EU
   is 220V. You will likely need to purchase a converter.
2. The TSA at airports can be very slow. It is recommended to arrive at
   the airport 3 hours before boarding begins.
3. You should lock your checked bag with a TSA-recommended lock. It
   makes your bag safer when going through the TSA.
4. It will be bad if you lose your passport while in a foreign country.
   Most hotels come with a safe. You should put the passport there and
   take photos of the pages with your photo and information.
5. Pick pockets are a nuissance. It is best to store your wallet in a
   zipped pocket or bag. Over-the-shoulder bags are a good choice.
